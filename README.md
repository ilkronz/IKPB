# IKPB
Isaac Kronz's Productivity Blocker 3.0

# Reasoning
This was made just for me.
Feel free to clone and modify as you like.
May get updated to meet my needs specifically.
I didn't want to pay $5 of Google Developer account cuz I'm cheap, so install it here

# Features
- Currently blocks Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Reddit, and LinkedIn.
- Timeboxes X and YT to 30 mins per day each and then blocks.
- Tracks number of times you attempted visiting a blocked site 
- Tracks time spent on X/YT
- Click the main message to change what you want it to say
- Archives of each day (this is so far untested)

# Installation

- Clone this repo locally (or just download, whatever option Github gives)
- Open Chrome
- Go to Extensions
- Turn on Developer mode in top right
- Load Unpacked
- Select the downloaded/cloned folder locally
- Congrats, it works
